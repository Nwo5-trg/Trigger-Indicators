## Bugs Reporting / Feature Request
This mod is very much a work-in-progress so if you have any feature requests or bug reports open a github issue or dm on discord.

**Bug reports about performance will probably be ignored, I'm aware that the code isnt the most optimised but I am working on it, don't just say "improve performance" or "im lagging"**
